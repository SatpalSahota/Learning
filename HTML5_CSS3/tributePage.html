      <li><strong>1897</strong> - Born on 15<sup>th</sup> November in Tredegar, Monmouthshire, Wales to a coal miner
        and a seamstress, one of ten children.
      <li><strong>1900</strong> - Leaves school at the age of thirteen, having repeated a year due to poor perfomance,
        and starts working at Ty-Trist colliery.
      <li><strong>1919</strong> - Attends the Central Labour College in London, having won a scholarship to attend

      <li><strong>1926</strong> - Starts working as a union member official. Helped to head the General Strike of 1926
        in the South Wales mining community.
      <li><strong>1928</strong> - Wins a seat on Monmouthshire City Council, shortly followed by winning the nomination
        for the parliamentary seat of Ebbw Vale, and holds the seat in the 1929 and 1931 general elections.
      <li><strong>1934</strong> - Marries Jennie Lee.
      <li><strong>1937</strong> - Speaks out against rearmament in response to the rise Adolf Hitler's Germany:<br><br><i>"If
          the immediate international situation is used as an excuse to get us to drop our opposition to the rearmament
          programme of the Government, the next phase must be that we must desist from any industrial or political
          action that may disturb national unity in the face of Fascist aggression. Along that road is endless retreat,
          and at the end of it a voluntary totalitarian State with ourselves erecting the barbed wire around. You
          cannot collaborate, you cannot accept the logic of collaboration on a first class issue like rearmament, and
          at the same time evade the implications of collaboration all along the line when the occasion demands it."</i>
